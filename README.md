# Stochastic Processes Project - Vicious Walker

The goal of this project is to simulate the dynamics of vicious walkers in 1,2,3-dimensional lattices. The notion of short ranged interacting random walkers was introduced by M E Fisher and was called vicious walker model. 
In such a vicious walkers system, it is interesting to study the number N of vicious walkers that have not yet interacted and annihilated each other until some time t. 
For 1-dimensional case, Fisher and Huse determined that the survival probability for such N vicious walkers walking on an infinite line at large times t decays according to

$$ Q(x,t) \sim t^{-\frac{N(N-1)}{4}} $$ 

We can change the system conditions e.g. use 2 or 3 dimensional system, impose different boundary conditions (get absorbed/reflected by the walls of the system upon interaction) or even alter the particlesâ€™ interaction mechanism (dynamics of walkers). Studying such different conditions is interesting.
